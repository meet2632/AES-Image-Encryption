# AES-Image-Encryption
 
This is a mini AES Image encryption project that I made during my last semester. The program takes any dimensional image file as an input converts it into two different encrypted and decrypted file of images one will be read by computer other does not. The method used is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
